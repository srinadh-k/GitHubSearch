# GitHubSearch

This project includes GitHub user search and their repositories search by using GitHub API V3

1. User needs to login with their Git Hub credentials.
2. Search Git Hub users with name and it will show user's avatar, name and along with their public repositories count.
3. User Details Page: This page user can see user detail information like as name, email, location, follower, following and bio.
4. User can search selected user's repositories in user's details page. 


Note: Due to time constraint, I have concentrated on output as like mentioned in document. But there are lot of scope for improvements.
